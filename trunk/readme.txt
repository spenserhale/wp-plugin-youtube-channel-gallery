== Description ==

Show a youtube video and a gallery of thumbnails for a youtube channel. When you click on one of the thumbnails the video plays at the top. This plugin uses the YouTube IFrame player API that allows YouTube to serve an HTML5 player rather than a Flash player for mobile devices that do not support Flash. You have the option to display a link to the youtube user channel.
